# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical responsive navigation issues in the YouthGuard application where the desktop layout incorrectly displays both header and sidebar simultaneously, and the mobile layout has non-functional hamburger menu toggle. The solution will implement proper responsive behavior where desktop shows only sidebar navigation and mobile shows a custom header with working toggle functionality.

## Glossary

- **Desktop Resolution**: Screen sizes 768px and above (md breakpoint and larger)
- **Mobile Resolution**: Screen sizes below 768px (below md breakpoint)
- **DashboardLayout**: The main layout component used for authenticated user pages
- **DashboardSidebar**: The navigation sidebar component for desktop users
- **Header**: The top navigation bar component for mobile users
- **Hamburger Menu**: The three-line icon button that toggles sidebar visibility on mobile
- **YouthGuard Logo**: The application branding displayed in the header
- **Sidebar Toggle**: The functionality to show/hide the sidebar on mobile devices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want to see only the sidebar navigation when logged in, so that I have a clean interface without redundant navigation elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop resolution, THE DashboardLayout SHALL display only the DashboardSidebar component
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop resolution, THE DashboardLayout SHALL NOT display the Header component
3. THE DashboardSidebar SHALL remain visible and functional on desktop resolutions without any toggle mechanism
4. THE DashboardLayout SHALL apply proper margin-left spacing to the main content area to accommodate the fixed sidebar on desktop

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see a custom header with logo and menu toggle, so that I can navigate the application effectively on small screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile resolution, THE DashboardLayout SHALL display the Header component
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile resolution, THE DashboardLayout SHALL NOT display the DashboardSidebar by default
3. THE Header component SHALL display the YouthGuard logo positioned on the left side on mobile resolutions
4. THE Header component SHALL display a hamburger menu icon positioned on the right side on mobile resolutions
5. THE Header component SHALL replace the desktop sidebar navigation entirely on mobile resolutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the hamburger menu to toggle the sidebar visibility, so that I can access navigation options when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the hamburger menu icon on mobile, THE DashboardLayout SHALL toggle the DashboardSidebar visibility
2. WHEN the DashboardSidebar is opened on mobile, THE DashboardLayout SHALL display an overlay background
3. WHEN a user clicks the overlay background, THE DashboardLayout SHALL close the DashboardSidebar
4. WHEN a user clicks the close button in the DashboardSidebar, THE DashboardLayout SHALL close the DashboardSidebar
5. WHEN a user navigates to a new page on mobile, THE DashboardLayout SHALL automatically close the DashboardSidebar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the navigation to adapt seamlessly across screen sizes, so that I have a consistent and appropriate experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen size changes from mobile to desktop, THE DashboardLayout SHALL automatically switch from header-based to sidebar-based navigation
2. WHEN the screen size changes from desktop to mobile, THE DashboardLayout SHALL automatically switch from sidebar-based to header-based navigation
3. THE responsive behavior SHALL activate at the 768px breakpoint (md breakpoint in Tailwind CSS)
4. THE navigation state SHALL persist appropriately during screen size transitions
5. THE layout transitions SHALL be smooth and not cause content jumping or layout shifts
